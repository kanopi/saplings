# Saplings - Drupal Build Starter Recipe

This recipe is designed to help start a highly configured Drupal project.

Rather than one large Recipe that tries to do everything, we've broken it up
into multiple sub-recipes.  This recipe installs them all, but you can also
install the sub-recipes on their own.

## Requiring and Applying this recipe

Apply a recipe to Drupal installed with a minimal profile.  See [below](#setting-up-a-quick-testing-environment)
 is you want to set up a quick testing environment.

- Follow the instructions in [kanopi/drupal-starter](https://github.com/kanopi/drupal-starter)
 to start a new project as it is configured for recipes and tooling needed.
- Run `fin composer require kanopi/saplings:^1` to require this repository.
- Run `fin recipe-apply ../recipes/saplings` to apply this recipe.
- Run the following command to unpack the dependencies from all kanopi/saplings recipes to the site project's composer.json file.
```
fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/gin-admin-experience && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-base && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-editorial && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-launch && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-content-types && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-component-types && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-component-base && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-content-base && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-media && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/imagemagick-configuration && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/arbor-theme && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-editorial && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-fields-header && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-fields-seo && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-full-html-editor && fin recipe-unpack drupal/tour_core

If you installed the events recipe, include following lines in your unpack command as well.

&& fin recipe-unpack kanopi/saplings-events && fin recipe-unpack drupal/events && fin recipe-unpack drupal/events_calendar && fin recipe-unpack drupal/events_locations && fin recipe-unpack kanopi/imagemagick-configuration && fin recipe-unpack drupal/locations

```
- Export configuration.

You can then remove the recipe once it has been applied and unpacked as the
configuration is now in your Drupal, and the dependencies are in your composer.

- `fin composer remove kanopi/saplings`
- Export configuration.

## Contributing/Testing
We'd love your help with testing, ideation, and development.

### Setting up a quick testing environment
Decide on a name for your testing environment.  In this example, I will use
`kanland`.

* Checkout kanopi/drupal-starter into it's own repo.
* `git clone git@github.com:kanopi/drupal-starter.git kanland && cd kanland`
* Open /.docksal/docksal.env in your editor.
* Update row 28 `hostingsite="kanland"` and save.
* Run `fin init`
* The build will fail with the following message as we haven't installed Drupal
  yet. `Error: Class "Drupal\user\Entity\User" not found`
* Run `fin drush si minimal -y && fin drush uli` to install Drupal and log in.
* Click on the one-time-login to verify the minimal install happened.
* Require this repository: `fin composer require kanopi/saplings:^1`
* Apply the recipe: `fin recipe-apply saplings`

To reset after you have done some testing:

* Run `fin init`
* The build will fail with the following message as we haven't installed Drupal
  yet. `Error: Class "Drupal\user\Entity\User" not found`
* Run `fin drush si minimal -y && fin drush uli` to install Drupal and log in.

### Requiring recipes
Use composer the require the recipes needed. We currently host on our packagist.

### Applying and Unpacking recipes in Drupal
To apply contrib/composer installed recipes, run the following commands:

`fin recipe-apply recipe-name`

Each recipe can have composer dependencies. "Unpacking" takes these dependencies
from the recipe and applies them to the project's composer.json file.

To unpack contrib/composer installed recipes, run the following commands:

`fin recipe-unpack recipe-name`

## Dependencies
